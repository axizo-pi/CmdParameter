/**
 * Trick to keep the contents of the String class outside of the
 * symbol table (ar index) of the compiled static library
 *
 * Basically, the contents of `Strings.cpp` is made local and static
 * to the current compile unit.
 *
 * This change was prompted due to usage of the same String class in
 * other static libraries.
 *
 * It's not possible to hide symbols at the linking stage; in `ar`,
 * adding symbols to the index is an all-or-nothing proposition.
 *
 * Note that any cpp-files added here ('Strings.cpp'), should NOT be
 * compiled separately in the build.
